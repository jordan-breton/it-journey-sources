## My work so far

Believe it or not, the first project I ever worked on was an ERP tailored to the specific needs of a growing construction company.

After my end-of-studies internship with them where I started the whole project alone, they hired me under a permanent contract. They were
amazed by my proposals and were really enthusiast, so do I! 

I somehow had to endorse the role of a project manager, a chief product officer, a database and application architect and a frontend engineer.

As you may expect at this point, it didn't ended very well, for the project at least. After one and half year working really hard, we agreed to break our contract,
since it became obvious that they didn't had enough budget to fund this kind of project, and that it was impossible for a junior developer, even with the best efforts,
to make it alone to the end.

### As a consultant/freelancer

Because of my singular journey through the IT world, my main speciality is to operate in several conditions:

- On legacy monolithic PHP/Nodejs codebases, where nobody wants to put their hands anymore.
- On frameworkless projects that lack of structure and conventions, either at early or late stage.
- On startup projects after the first releases have been deployed, to do cleanup, debugging and refactoring.

By the way, most of the time those project are not document or very poorly, but it's not a problem.

Code is code.

Il love to see myself as a speleologist. My missions may vary from bug tracking to add new features. In many cases, I'm asked to produce
various detailed report on the organisation's codebase, architecture, database structure, performances and basic security.

I even helped in some occasions to elaborate a strategy to allow a slow migration of a codebase from a chaotic state to something
more maintainable and extensible.

### By my side, as an entrepreneur

Building an entire systems from ground up to rooftop is my favorite thing in life, beside playing with my son and dating my lovely wife, obviously :)
