You'll find below a quick overview of my resume. As I early started to work my own businesses, I can't
quote all the compagnies I worked with either as a consultant, a freelance or a contractor both for privacy and brevity sakes.

Yet, the quickest way to grasp my personality and my IT journey is to read the following short version of my history.

If you're interested in a more detailed resume, please [read this more detailed version](/about/story.md).

### 2012

I Graduated from high school with a science oriented baccalaureate.

### 2012 - 2013

Not yet sure about my orientation, I took a year of skills upgrade classes for applied arts (MANAA in French).
I loved every second of it but in the course of this year, I discovered that what I enjoyed the most
applying my creativity to was programming, that I started to learn out of pure curiosity.

This curiosity promptly transformed into a strong interest, then a passion. At the end of the year, I took the
decision to overcome my [fear of not being smart enough](/blog) to make a career in IT and applied for a 2 years degree at
university.

### 2013 - 2015

I Graduated from 2 years IT degree in the French university [IUT Robert Schuman](https://iutrs.unistra.fr/english), Strasbourg, France, 
where I acquired really strong bases. 

During this period, I loved (and still love!) to create various side projects. From an AES 128 implementation, to a basic CMS
framework or, last but not least, the creation of my first personal website (dedicated to a novel I was writing at this moment) with a forum, hosted on a (very badly configured) VPS.

Following the excellents results I got from my internship presentation in front of a jury, I decided to 
seize this opportunity.

### 2015 - 2017

Following my internship whose main goal was to evaluate and start building a web based ERP tailored to the specific needs of a construction company, I signed
my first long-term contract to pursue this project.

You should take a look at this obviously predictable failure story [there](/blog). That being said, if I had to go back in time to do it again, I would without hesitation. It was a hard time to get through at this moment,
but the lessons I learned from it were priceless.

### 2017 - 2020

I decided to start my own web agency by using a [PHP framework](/projects/archived-projects) written as a side project in the previous years. It was a successful
experience that allowed me to work with various environments, persons and even technologies.

During this period, I completed, enlarged and thorough my skills to grow as fullstack web developer, project manager
and business owner. I did learn management skills as well as negotiation, administrative management, customer relationship,
marketing and communication.

Take a look at this story [there](/blog).

### 2020 - Today

Even if building simple to complex showcase and e-commerce websites was interesting, after almost three years
I decided to move toward a more fulfilling job as a consultant and freelancer.

This period is much more technical and allows me to put my hands on very different (and [often chaotic](/about/story#as-a-consultantfreelancer)) 
pieces of software. Working to their extension, maintenance, troubleshooting, documentation and/or replacement is something I'm enjoying a lot.

In the same time, I wrote a [Dark Fantasy book](https://www.amazon.fr/Sang-rancune-Jordan-Breton/dp/2491696002) in French,
started to build a [NodeJS ecosystem](/projects/current-projects) to try to address several [NPM problems](/blog) and have fun
building something huge and modular from scratch. I even started to learn digital painting as a hobby.

### Tomorrow

Even if I love what I'm doing right now, I kinda start to feel the urge to move forward again. Being passionated and
amazed by the cyber-security field since I started my IT journey, I'm currently preparing several certifications to finally
get into this fascinating domain.

Since this step forward is a very important one to me, I made a [certifications roadmap](/about/skill-set#roadmap) and will create
a [YouTube channel]() about my progression. The main goal being to be better at speaking english, keep motivation to learn the tremendous amount
 of things I have to learn to achieve my objective and share with potentially interested people my experience doing so.

May it be an encouragement for some folks around there that would want to enter the cyber-security field too and didn't dared to make the first move yet :)
