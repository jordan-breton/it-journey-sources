<div class="content" markdown>
My name is Jordan Breton.

I'm a Fullstack Web Developer since 2015 and I'm offering **freelancing** and **consulting** for various individuals and small-to-medium-sized companies.

**I fear no project**. No matter what technologies yours was built upon, no matter if it is a well known and shiny well-documented stack or an obscur uncommented homemade
system. Code is code. IT is IT.

I'm a passionated developer, and I strongly believe in what **John Heywood** said: 

> Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.

## The website

**It Journey** has three main purposes:

- Being a starting point to my career shift toward cyber-security
- Sharing my knowledge and my journey as a fullstack web developer
- Introducing myself to all of those who would want to work with me in a way or another

If you want more details about the genesis of this website, check the [first blog article](/blog/2023/02/21/hello-world) that explains this in more details :wink:
