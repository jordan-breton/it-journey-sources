# Certifications roadmap

As stated in many places on this website, my mid-term objective is to inflect my journey to move from
the **software design** world to **cybersecurity**. The amount of knowledge I must acquire is pretty huge,
but not as much as it would be for someone that would start his IT career from the very beginning.

I'm convinced that learning cybersecurity will be win-win: I'll be better at **software design**, and my **software design** background
will benefit to the future **cybersecurity** expert I want to become.

Since no one should start such a journey without picking up a map, let's see what mine is.

!!! note "About nomenclature"

    Most milestones embed three steps: 

    - courses: full courses followed taking notes
    - study: learned, ready to pass the exam
    - exam: exam passed

    For **CompTIA A+ core 1** and **core 2**, the idea is to be sure to land my future cybersecurity knowledge focus on **strong** bases, to fill eventual gaps.
    Since it requires to passe two exams, and that I already need to get a fair amount of certifications to pay at the moment, I'll not pass the exam for core 1 nor core 2 in a near future
    to save money for more useful certifications first.
