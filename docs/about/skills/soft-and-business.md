[^3]:
Working hard to run my own businesses early in my career while being alone for very long years [was really challenging](/blog).
But my motivation to stay the course and move forward never wavers, especially in the most difficult moments.
[^4]:
As a business owner myself for quite a time, budget management was obviously a mandatory skill to learn.
[^5]:
As a lonely developer with very few resources and a small-to-inexistant network when I started my IT-Journey, I had to deal with incredibly very limited time, money and skills.
Dealing with this kind of restrictions strengthened my abilities to prioritize and delay where needed.
[^6]:
My time estimates improved greatly over years but let's be honest, there is still room for improvement :smile:.
No matter how much I try to stop underestimate the time needed to do something, my optimistic nature just keep to stay in the way.
This is one of those domains where time and practice are the only way to mastery.

## Soft skills

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-    :fontawesome-solid-users:{ .lg }  **Team working**

     ---

     Being able to work together with the same goal in mind and a strong cohesion sense is crucial to
     succeed as a developer. But it's even more important when it comes to build something.

     I'm naturally open to others, friendly and eager to share whether it be about the projects I'm working on
     or just every IT related (or not) subjects.

-    :material-puzzle-edit:{ .lg }  **Adaptability**

     ---

     My missions in the past few years were very different, with many companies, tools, people or even
     workflow that adaptation became a second nature.

     Not only am I adapting to your project, team and processes, but I'll do my best for my code to be
     as close as possible as the codebase I'm working on. Codebase homogeneity is one of the most important
     things to maintain accros a project's lifecycle.

-    :material-creation:{ .lg } **Creativity**

     ---

     Creativity is such a fascinating thing. Some people refers to it as a gift. I strongly disagree.
     I rather see creativity as a muscle: the more we invest time and effort to create new things, the most creative we become.

     Being creative is an **active process**. We're not creating many things *because we're creative*. We're creative
     **because we're trying to create as many things as possible, as often as possible**.

-    :material-graph:{ .lg } **Resourcefulness & curiosity**

     ---

     My work is not about knowing or memorizing everything, but rather knowing were to search for, keeping my knowledge up to date
     and reading/listening/watching as much as possible about as different non-related subjects as possible.

     This way, I can dig and thorough a subject later, when I think that it maybe useful for my current task, mission or project.

-    :material-lightning-bolt:{ .lg }  **Critical thinking**

     ---

     Most of my side project's purpose is exactly this. Before even trying a new framework/library, I try
     to ask myself: How would **I** solve the problems it solves?

     Implementing a proof of concept before using a library/a framework feature is something I do a lot. It not only help me improve
     my skills overtime, but it help me spot my solutions strengths and weaknesses.

-    :fontawesome-solid-hand-peace:{ .lg } **Openness to criticism**

     ---

     Writing code is not just about applying technical knowledge. It's about solving problem in a creative way. The *creative way*
     part is such a subjective thing that not being able to keep a certain distance with our code may poison our developer career.

     I don't see criticism has something against me, but as something that will help being a better at what I do. As such, substantiate critics are always welcome.
