# Skills

The following skill sets are as exhaustive as possible. The level scale is inspired by the
[CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)
to offer the most descriptive and simplest way of evaluating my skills.

There is the adapted nomenclature:

!!! warning annotate "Important"

    As you read this, keep in mind that learning fast is part of my daily job.

    I have a very strong understanding of the web ecosystem as a whole, from networking to web technologies. I know 
    what's behind main frameworks in web stacks, what problem they do solves (and those they don't), as such I can be operationnal in a matter of days(1)
    on a new framework or technology I don't yet know.

    Being operational meaning reaching the `Elementary` level, and such being able to understand the tool and the code, the philophy behind it and, of course, to work with it.

1.  If a good documentation can be provided. Without any documentation, the delay would either be a week or more depending of the degree of
    rigor employed while developing said tool.
