# Welcome on the **IT-Journey** blog!

??? abstract "About this blog"
    
    ## What will you find in this blog?

    Pretty much anything **IT** related; from tutorials to thoughts and experiences in **programming**, **DBA**, **sysadmin**, **tech**, **security**, **hardware**, **software**, **tools**... 
    There is so much to talk about, and still so much to learn!
    
    This is the beauty of **IT**: no matter how much you work, learn and practice, no matter how much time and efforts you put at it, there will still be something *you don't know*.
    Something you *missed*. Something *more*. Something *new* (or only new to *you*!) to deep dive in. It's also the most frustrating part of this field: you can't know everything.
    
    Is it really that impossible? **Yes, it is.**<br>
    Does-it means that we should not try? **Maybe.**<br>
    Will-it prevent us to keep trying? **Surely not!**
