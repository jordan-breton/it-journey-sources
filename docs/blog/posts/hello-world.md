# Hello world!

What an inspired title for a first article posted on an IT blog, isn't it? Sadly, I wasn't able to resist the temptation, and here's what it looks like!

This idea of sharing about my projects and experience is not quite new. I have long wanted to start a website
like this but never found either the time nor, to be honest, the courage to do so. So long that I didn't even graduated when I thought about it,
something like 9 years ago.

## It all started on Medium

The thing is... the last day, while I was reading an article on Medium about the **SOLID principle**, I started to write
a (too) long comment about how I thought the author was mistakenly confusing two concepts. While writing it, I also thought
about those thousands of pretty bad posts about programming we can find on this kind of website. I felt angry.

I used to find them pretentious, because it is obvious that their authors write about something they don't really understand.

Before sending my comment, I proofread it and this time, it made me step back a few minutes. I thought about my journey and how much I learnt along the way.

It helped me realize few things.

## I don't think I would have done better

If I had started to write about programming when I started to code 9 years ago, I would have written bad articles too.
I would have made at least equivalent and most likely worst mistakes **in good faith** and with **good intentions**. 

All I would have wanted to do, would have been to just share about my passion, about my findings, about my journey.

## Experience vs knowledge 

Obviously, those authors are not pretentious (at least most of them), they're just wrong because programming and IT in general is a very complex field in which experience is crucial.

Some points can only be deeply understood once experimented. In that case, the **need** for the **SOLID principal** is something you can conceive but that most of us will really understand
when we'll have to rewrite half our project because not applying it at all, or very poorly.

Doing so, you'll understand in your bones why it is important, 
why it must be taken very seriously and why it exists in the first place.

## Self-confidence vs self-awareness

Even today, with my knowledge and my experience, I'm not immune to being wrong or having misunderstood a key concept, while still being convinced of the opposite. 
Learning is a matter of conflict between what we think we know and what we effectively know. 

Believing that we know is important for **self-confidence**. Being proved wrong in a way or another is important
to **progress**. Balancing **self-confidence** and **self ignorance awareness** is ^^hard^^. I mean... really **hard**.

## To conclude

I finally sent my comment after some corrections, thinking afterward that It would have been a better move to write an article about the mistake the author did. And I will :smile:

This is this website genesis. I'll not pretend to be the only one that knows about `The Great IT Truth`, but let's start discussions about
all and everything IT related. Let's talk about the difference between the idea, the theory, the practice and the experience.

Let's challenge what we think we know.

Let's try to go a little further than usual.

Let's start this journey together :wink:
