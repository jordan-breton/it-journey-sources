# Hello world!

What an inspired title for a first article posted on an IT blog, isn't it? Sadly, I wasn't able to resist the temptation, and here's what it looks like!

This idea of sharing about my projects and experience is not quite new. I have long wanted to start a website
like this but never found either the time nor, to be honest, the courage to do so. So long that I didn't even graduated when I thought about it,
something like 9 years ago.

<!-- more -->

The thing is... the last day, while I was reading an article on Medium about the **SOLID principle**, I started to write
a (too) long comment about how I thought the author was mistakenly confusing two concepts. While writing it, I also thought
about those thousands of pretty bad posts about programming we can find on this kind of websites, feeling a little angry about them.

I used to find them pretentious, because it is obvious that their authors write about something they don't really understand.

Before sending it, I proofread my comment and this time, it made me step back a few minutes. I thought about my journey and how much I learnt along the way.

It helped me realize few things:

1. If I had started to write about programming when I started to code 9 years ago, I would have written bad articles too.
   I would have made at least equivalent and most likely worst mistakes **in good faith** and with **good intentions**. All I would have wanted to do, would have been to just share about my passion.
2. Obviously, those authors are not pretentious (at least most of them), they're just wrong because programming and IT in general is a very complex field in which experience is crucial.
   Some points can only be deeply understood once experimented. In that case, the **need** for the **SOLID principal** is something you can conceive but that most of us will really understand
   when we'll have to rewrite half our project because not applying at all, or very poorly. Doing so, you'll understand in your bones why it is important, why it must be taken very seriously and why it just exists in the first place.
3. Even today, with my knowledge and my experience, I'm not immune to being wrong or having misunderstood a key concept.

I finally sent my comment after some corrections, thinking afterward that It would have been a better move to write an article about the mistake the author did.

And so this website is born. I'll not pretend to be the only one that know the great IT Truth, but let's start discussions about
all and everything IT related. Let's talk about the difference between the idea, the theory, the practice and the experience.

Let's try to go a little further than usual.

Let's start this journey together :wink:
