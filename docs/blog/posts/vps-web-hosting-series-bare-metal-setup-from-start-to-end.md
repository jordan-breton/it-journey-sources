# VPS & Web Hosting Series: Bare-metal setup from start to end

Fully configuring a **VPS** by hand when everybody seems to only rely on cloud nowadays? Really? You'd be surprised to find out
that many compagnies still use **VPSs** or **dedicated servers**, especially when they want to run a non-conventional web application, their own private cloud
or even to reduce infrastructure costs. 

And that's not to mention the fact that many cloud provider (like **AWS**) just provide you
an instance that is... a **VPS** that still needs to be configured!

In this series of three articles, lets dive into a case study based on several real setups.

This series have been split in three equivalent episodes: 

1. [VPS & Web Hosting series part 1: Installation](/blog/2023/02/27/vps-web-hosting-series-part-1-installation/)
2. [VPS & Web Hosting series part 2: Configuration](/blog/2023/02/28/vps-web-hosting-series-part-2-configuration/)
3. [VPS & Web Hosting series part 3: Maintenance & additional notes](/blog/2023/03/01/vps-web-hosting-series-part-3-maintenance-additional-notes/)

For learning purpose, I added some gotchas. These articles are **advanced** one but should be readable for beginners
with a bit of time and efforts :smile:

I'm very excited about it. It was a lot of work to come up with, and since it's the first actual tutorial I ever wrote,
I hope it will be clear and detailed enough for you to enjoy it! Any feedback would be welcome :wink:
