# WIP (Writing in progress)

!!! warning "Sorry, this article has not been published yet!"

The link that led you there is not broken. Sometimes, when I'm writing something I think:

!!! quote "Hey, this would be a great idea for an article!"

So I drop a link where the idea came up and add the article idea on my [TODO list](/todo). When I'm not too busy or if I need a break, 
I read my TODO list to pick up a subject and... well, a new article is published.

So...  the article you're looking for will come... one day or another :wink:

Just be patient :smile:
