# Looking for someone to work on your project?

Working with someone new is far from easy. As a business owner myself, I know how hard it can be to
trust someone you don't know to put his/her hands onto your project, whether you own a big company or
start a new project alone.

That's one of the purpose of this website! There, you'll find everything you would want to know about me,
but let me introduce myself first!

My name is Jordan Breton, I'm an experienced fullstack web developer with 8 years of development under my belt.
I worked on dozens of pieces of software, from pet projects becoming serious to mature (and sometimes legacy) products with an
active customer base for years.

## Why me?

<div class="skills-overview" markdown>

-    ## :fontawesome-solid-earth-americas: **Global approach**

     --------

     As a fullstack developer and business owner, I don't only think about backend, fronted, APIs, architecture nor
     good practices. I also take infrastructure, costs, management, team skills, budgets, client's need, product's specificities
     into consideration to bring you the best advices in your situation for your product.

-    ## :material-bookshelf: **Deep knowledge & experience**

     --------

     The web ecosystem is tremendously large. I would never pretend to know everything about it, it would be a lie. But
     I know enough of it to deeply understand it. Designing an application or choosing wisely between available technologies 
     while keeping an eye on the dependency graph of your project require both deep knowledge and experience.
     
-    ## :material-google-my-business: **Business management skills**

     --------

     There is nothing more frustrating that having to deal with someone that don't understand how much business world is
     different from the technical world. As such, identifying which technical debts are worth taking on from those who must
     be avoided at any cost demand both technical and business knowledge.

-    ## :fontawesome-solid-wand-magic-sparkles: **Polyvalent skills**

     --------

     From API design to low level protocols, from backend security to frontend technology available in browsers. From refactoring 
     to documentation writing. From database creation to software architecture. From development to deployment. From technical
     knowledge to business experience.

-    ## :fontawesome-solid-unlock: **Open minded**

     --------

     Rigorous can be a quality. But without a bit of flexibility, it quickly changes into dogmatism. There is a time and a place for
     everything. To start writing tests, to start writing documentation, to design clean and **SOLID** code or to sprint with a 
     dirty workaround, to start optimizing something or even to refactor a large part of a codebase.

-    ## :material-clock-fast: **Fast at problem solving**

     --------

     Your project's need is too specific? Your problem is hard to grasp? I'll provide you several options to choose from
     to quickly move forward and stay productive. From brainstorming to pseudo or full implementation, I may get you out of trouble
     in a matter of hours.
