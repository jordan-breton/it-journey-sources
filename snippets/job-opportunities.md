!!! info "What about hiring for short or long term contracts?"

    I'm **open** to great job opportunities, but it heavily depends on the project and the post you want me to occupy.
    Do not hesitate to reach me anyway, we may start a beautiful collaboration together :wink:

    Just be clear from the beginning about your proposition, it will save both of us time and energy!

    That being said, I'm more likely to accept a great opportunity in **cybersecurity** :wink:
